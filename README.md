# Hangman-OOP
This is a hangman game I made using OOP. I made it from about 330 to 6pm 11/5/21.
Coneceptually the game was easy for me to plan, which went well at first.
Then I couldn't for the life of me figure out how I was going to replace '_ ' with correctly guessed letters. I ended up having to stackoverflow it.
I really hopped I didn't have to use it but just couldn't wrap my head around what I needed to do but oh well, you live and you learn.
I also didn't like that you had to sit through the intro after you say 'yes' to the program asking if you want to play again.
So I just copied and pasted the main game loop again in another function so you could skip it.
